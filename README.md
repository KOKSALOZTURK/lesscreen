Project Title:
==============
Lesscreen – A Minimal Screen Activity Platform

Overview:
=========
Lesscreen is a modern, minimalistic web application designed to help users focus by reducing digital noise. The platform provides quick access to engaging yet calm activities for children, parents, and educators. It is a curated space offering downloadable resources, creative ideas, and simple interaction – all within a distraction-free interface.

📊 📈 On several pages of the platform, **downloadable resources and activity-related datasets are cleared, scanned and visualized through interactive charts**. These visualizations provide valuable insights and comparisons across age groups and activity types — helping educators and families make informed choices.
